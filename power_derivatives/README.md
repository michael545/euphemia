## Power Derivatives & Open Questions 

This is about understanding the broader derivatives market for electricity:
- **Hedging Volume??:** How much vol. is really meant for hedging risk purposes vs. speculative or counter-trading (Citadel/2sigma) ?
- **Swaps & Options:**
    - Are energy markets more efficient than traditional equities?
    - How common are swaps (fixed for floating / spark spreads), are they best kept under the radar?
    - Who are the hedges with options / parties that exchange swaps?
    - How are CFDs & fixed-for-floating swaps structured?
    - What is the liquidity picture like for these instruments?
    - Who are the main market makers for options?
    - Who plays the game solely because of stat arbitrage and inefficiencies
- **Counterparty Risk:** How do clearing houses (e.g., ECC) model and manage default risk of participants?
- **PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements):**
    - Often related to renewable energy projects.
    - Virtual PPAs (VPPAs) are also a factor.
- **Exchange Expiries:** Considerations around outdated expiry conventions at exchanges.
