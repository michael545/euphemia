# Core Simulation Logic

This directory will house the core components of the EUPHEMIA simulation.

- `grid_simulation.py`: Module for simulating the electricity grid, including transmission constraints.
- `cost_optimization.py`: Module for the cost function optimization, a central part of the EUPHEMIA algorithm.
