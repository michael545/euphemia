## Introduction to EUPHEMIA

- PCR project -- power coupling of regions (2009), SLO-IT (Day Ahead coupling in 2011)
- EUPHEMIA: Pan-European Hybrid Electricity Market Integration Algorithm
- Implemented in FEB 2014 following COSMOS/SESAME (Cross-border Optimisation of SMOS)
- Aims for transparency in the computation of prices and flows.
- Solves a complex optimization problem (typically MIQP - Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming) to achieve market coupling.

## Key Concepts

- **Market Coupling (MC):** Eliminates the need to acquire separate transmission capacity rights for cross-border trades. Trades are determined by the MC mechanism.
- **Economic Surplus (Welfare):** The algorithm maximizes the sum of consumer surplus, producer surplus, and congestion rent across all regions.
- **Flow-Based Constraints:** Power flows induced by executed orders (net positions) must not exceed the capacity of the network.
- **PTDF (Power Transfer Distribution Factor):** Indicates how much net positions (energy exchanges) utilize the capacity of specific network elements.
- **RAM (Remaining Available Margin):** The available capacity (in MW) on a network constraint for energy exchanges.
- **Implicit Auction:** Transmission capacity is allocated implicitly along with the energy.

## Market Participants and Roles

- **TSOs (Transmission System Operators):** Provide transmission system constraints to the EUPHEMIA algorithm. ENTSO-E (European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity) has 40 TSOs from 36 countries (some countries have multiple bidding zones).
- **NEMOs (Nominated Electricity Market Operators):** Entities designated by governing bodies to operate electricity markets and interact with EUPHEMIA.
- **Market Participants Generators/Consumers:** Submit bids (asks/offers) for electricity (e.g., generators, retailers, large consumers).
    - Example: BSP SouthPool (Slovenian day-ahead market).

## Regulatory Framework

- **ACER (European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators):** Plays a significant oversight role.
- **National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs):** Regulate national electricity markets.
- Key EU Regulations:
    - MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II)
    - EMIR (European Market Infrastructure Regulation)
    - REMIT (Regulation on Wholesale Energy Market Integrity and Transparency)

## Swaps and Financial Instruments

For an explanation valuation and modelling  of power swaps and related derivatives like VPPAs, see [swaps_explained.md](./swaps_explained.md).

- How much vol needs to be hedged, how much vol is pure speculation/counter trading?
- Are swaps common? Who buys options? Who writes contracts for these swaps(fixed for floating) How liquid are they?
- Who can market make options?
- PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements) / VPPAS(virtual Power  Purchase Agreements) renewables/hedging.

## EUPHEMIA Simulation (Python)

This repository includes a simplified Python-based simulation to illustrate some core concepts of EUPHEMIA.
Navigate to the [euphemia_simulation directory](./euphemia_simulation/README.md) for more details and to run the simulation.

## Further Reading and Resources

Additional documents, papers are in the [docs directory](./docs/README.md).

CWE - Central Western Europe

BSP SouthPool -- Where slovenians submit asks/bids for day ahead

Eupehmia receives as an input to the algorithm transmission system constraints by the TSOs

NEMO - Nominated Electricity Market Operators --asigned by the governing bodies

PTDF -- (Power Transfer Distribution Factor): This is a ratio that indicates how much the net positions (resulting from energy exchanges) use the capacity of specific network elements.
RAM (Remaining Available Margin): This represents the number of MW available for energy exchanges on a specific network constraint (or critical network element)
